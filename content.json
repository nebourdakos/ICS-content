"latestNews": "We have been keeping busy with fundraising and donations despite COVID-19! The money raised during our large merch sale was used to donate toys and ice cream gift cards to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Our donations were given out to kids after their appointments, so they could always leave the hospital with a smile! This winter, we raised money through an Instagram fundraiser to buy and donate gifts through USPS Operation Santa!"
